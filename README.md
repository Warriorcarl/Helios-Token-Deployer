## Overview

This project is a modern, responsive DApp for deploying ERC20 tokens on the Helios blockchain. It was developed through multiple iterations and improvisations to ensure an optimal experience on both desktop and mobile devices. The DApp features an intuitive interface, a dynamic token logo generator, a robust deployment console, and a convenient dropdown menu to access future features.

## Key Features & Improvements

- **Responsive Layout:** Automatically adapts to desktop (two columns) and mobile (single column, centered, all elements spaced for readability).
- **Form Consistency:** All input fields, select boxes, and action buttons (Deploy, Generate Random Logo, Upload Image) are visually consistent with matching border-radius and sizing.
- **Connect Wallet Button:** Enlarged and styled to match other buttons, with improved color contrast for readability.
- **Dropdown Menu:** Accessible via a menu icon next to Connect Wallet, listing available and upcoming features ("Cron Job", "Deploy NFT", etc.).
- **Token Symbol Input:**
  - Automatically capitalizes all input.
  - Shows an error if more than 5 characters are entered.
- **Token Logo Generator:**
  - Dynamically adjusts font size if the symbol exceeds 3 letters so the logo remains visually balanced.
- **Deployment Console:**
  - Restored to display all relevant information after successful token deployment (transaction, address, name, symbol, supply, etc.).
- **Upload Button:** Now visually matches other action buttons in size, color, and border radius.
- **Error Handling:** User receives immediate feedback for invalid input and deployment status.
